Hey there! Welcome to npm-like-im-5.\nThis book contains the curriculum for a 6hr introduction to\nnpm designed to be appropriate for a classically \"non-technical\"\naudience.\nWhat's This Book About?\nThe goal of this book is to give you a solid foundation in npm\npractices and concepts. The focus is both practical and theoretical;\nthis book takes the stance that knowing how and why to do \nsomething is critical to successfully using any technology.\nAdditionally, this book hopes to reveal some of the motivation of\nwhy npm has developed the way it has. Understanding the \nreasoning behind specific features and implementations will help\nyou employ the myriad features npm offers at the right time, as\nwell as help you debug, should you run into trouble.\nThere are 8 chapters included:\n1. Introduction\n  We'll kick off our class by introducing npm and npm, Inc.\n  From there, we'll talk about dependency hell and how\n  package managers historically have attempted to solve this\n  problem. Finally, we'll discuss how the Node.js module\n  loader enables package managers in the Node.js ecosystem\n  bypass dependency hell and how npm2 worked.\n2. Hello, npm!\n  In this chapter we'll take a deep dive in npm3 and how it\n  works. We'll focus on some of the gotchas npm3 might\n  throw at you and teach you how to debug and fix them.\n3. Up and Running\n  In this chapter we'll get ourselves set up with a Node.js\n  environment using nvm. We'll learn how to update our npm\n  and switch between versions.\n4. Using Packages\n  One of npm's biggest value propositions is its Registry,\n  where all the community contributed packages live. In this\n  chapter, we'll learn how to install these packages, both\n  locally and globally and we'll explore how packages are\n  managed on our local machines. Finally, we'll learn about\n  package.json, a way we can list the packages we need\n  for a specific project.\n5. Semantic Versioning (Semver)\n  Not necessarily a part of npm, Semantic Versioning, or Semver\n  is a critical standard upon which all software is built, and\n  upon which npm relies. We'll discover how Semver allows us\n  to express the versions of a package we can use in a project\n  as well as what version numbers are meant to express to us\n  as software users.\n6. Publishing a Package\n  Using packages from the npm Registry is great, but we'd all be\n  nowhere if no one contributed their own packages. In this\n  chapter we'll build a small project and publish it on the npm\n  Registry. We'll also briefly discuss options npm, Inc offers\n  the community for organizing package access.\n7. Run Scripts\n  npm is a lot more than just a package manager! npm run scripts\n  offer a built in way to automate tasks within your project. In\n  this chapter, we'll learn how to write default start and test\n  scripts, as well as how we can create custom scripts. We'll\n  also explore the lifecycle events that npm provides by default\n  and learn how these can be leveraged in our development\n  workflows.\n8. Conclusion\n  Great job! You made it. We'll summarize all the things we went\n  through and discuss some awesome things you can do to \n  continue your learning.\n"},"intro/":{"url":"intro/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nWelcome to npm-like-im-5!

It has two\nprimary goals:\n\nput code in a place where it can easily be used\nmanage differences in dependency versions\n\nnpm accomplishes this by managing 3 primary products:\n\nthe CLI\nthe registry\nthe website\n\nThe CLI\nnpm's CLI, or Command Line Interface, is an installed program that allows\nusers to interact with a registry via their terminal. This is by far the most well-known and used npm product.\nThe Registry\nnpm's registry is, arguably, the most valuable asset that npm has.\nThe registry is a database (actually serveral databases!) that contains\nall package data and meta-data.\nWhen one types npm install (among other things!) a request is made to\nthe registry.\nIt is possible to use the npm CLI with any registry. The npm registry\nis simply the default.\nnpm OnSite\nnpm OnSite is a paid product by which npm provides customers\nwith a fully replicated version of the public registry for use\nbehind company firewalls.\nThe Website\nThe website is npm's home on the World Wide Web. It has two primary goals:\n\ndisplay package READMEs\nallow users to manage package permissions via Orgs and Teams\n\nPackage READMEs\nThe primary function of the website is to allow users to search\nfor packages and read information on them. Information on each\npackage is found in a README.md file in the root directory of\nthe package repository (often, GitHub).\nnpm uses a package called marky-markdown to parse package READMEs\nand displays it on the website. It attempts to parse and display the\nfiles exactly as GitHub does, but currently is not.\nthere.\nOrgs and Teams\nAs of last November, npm offers a new service called \"Orgs and Teams\"\nwhich grants users the ability to manage permissions to packages.\nThis is currently only a paid product, but an open source tier will be\navailable in the future.\n"},"intro/app-design.html":{"url":"intro/app-design.html","title":"Modularity and Application Design","keywords":"","body":"Modularity and Application Design\nNow that we know what npm is -- a fair question is \"why npm?\"\nModularity\nModularity is a software architecture concept that pertains to\nthe degree to which a system's components may be separated and\nrecombined.\nBenefits of modularity include:\n\neasier to maintain\neasier to test\neasier to reason about\n\nProblems:\n\nlocating and using modules is difficult\nupdating modules is difficult\n\n"},"intro/packages-and-modules.html":{"url":"intro/packages-and-modules.html","title":"Packages and Modules","keywords":"","body":"Packages and Modules\nOne of the key steps in becoming immersed in an ecosystem is learning\nits vocabulary. Node.js and npm have very specific definitions of\npackages and modules, which are easy to mix up. We'll discuss those\ndefinitions here, make them distinct, and explain why certain\ndefault files are named the way they are.\ntl;dr\n\nA package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json.\nThis can happen in a bunch of different ways! For more info, see\n\"What is a package?\", below.\nA module is any file or directory that can be loaded by Node.js'\nrequire(). Again, there are several configurations that allow this to\nhappen. For more info, see \"What is a module?\", below.\n\nWhat is a package?\nA package is any of:\n\na) a folder containing a program described by a package.json file\nb) a gzipped tarball containing (a)\nc) a url that resolves to (b)\nd) a @ that is published on the registry with (c)\ne) a @ that points to (d)\nf) a  that has a latest tag satisfying (e)\ng) a git url that, when cloned, results in (a).\n\nNoting all these package possibilities, it follows that even if you never\npublish your package to the public registry, you can still get a lot of\nbenefits of using npm:\n\nif you just want to write a node program, and/or\nif you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere after packing\nit up into a tarball\n\nGit urls can be of the form:\ngit://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish\ngit+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish\ngit+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish\ngit+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish\nThe commit-ish can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as\nan argument to git checkout.  The default is master.\nWhat is a module?\nA module is anything that can be loaded with require() in a Node.js\nprogram.  The following are all examples of things that can be\nloaded as modules:\n\nA folder with a package.json file containing a main field.\nA folder with an index.js file in it.\nA JavaScript file.\n\nMost npm packages are modules\nGenerally, npm packages that are used in Node.js program are loaded\nwith require, making them modules. However, there's no requirement\nthat an npm package be a module!  \nSome packages, e.g., cli packages only contain an executable\ncommand-line interface, and don't provide a main field for use in\nNode.js programs. These packages are not modules.\nAlmost all npm packages (at least, those that are Node programs)\ncontain many modules within them (because every file they load with\nrequire() is a module).\nIn the context of a Node program, the module is also the thing that\nwas loaded from a file.  For example, in the following program:\nvar req = require('request')\nwe might say that \"The variable req refers to the request module\".\nFile and Directory Names in the Node.js and npm Ecosystem\n\nSo, why is it the node_modules folder, but package.json file?\nWhy not node_packages or module.json?\n\nThe package.json file defines the package.  (See\n\"What is a package?\", above.)\nThe node_modules folder is the place Node.js looks for modules.\n(See \"What is a module?\", above.)\nFor example, if you create a file at node_modules/foo.js and then\nhad a program that did var f = require('foo.js'), it would load\nthe module.  However, foo.js is not a \"package\" in this case,\nbecause it does not have a package.json.\nAlternatively, if you create a package which does not have an\nindex.js or a \"main\" field in the package.json file, then it is\nnot a module.  Even if it's installed in node_modules, it can't be\nan argument to require().\n"},"intro/dependency-hell.html":{"url":"intro/dependency-hell.html","title":"Package Managers and Dependency Hell","keywords":"","body":"Package Managers and Dependency Hell\nImagine there are three modules: A, B, and C.

In all other runtimes prior to Node.js, this is\nwhat a package manager would try to do.

They were both written in large part by the same person,\nnpm, Inc. CEO, Isaac Z. Schlueter. Like 2 sides of the same piece of \npaper, npm and the Node.js module loader are what make Node.js\na uniquely well-suited runtime for dependency management.\n"},"npm3/":{"url":"npm3/","title":"Hello, npm!","keywords":"","body":"Hello, npm!\nNow that you know about npm, the Company, and the Node.js ecosystem that npm particpates in, let's dive into how npm manages packages.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this section, we'll learn:\n\nHow npm3 resolves dependencies and how this is different from npm2\nHow and why duplication happens in npm3 and how to mitigate it\nWhy the structure of the node_modules directory is non-deterministic\n\n"},"npm3/dependency-resolution.html":{"url":"npm3/dependency-resolution.html","title":"Dependency Resolution","keywords":"","body":"Dependency Resolution\nnpm3 resolves dependencies differently than npm2. \nWhile npm2 installs all dependencies in a nested way, npm3 tries to\nmitigate the deep trees and redundancy that such nesting causes. npm3\nattempts this by installing some secondary dependencies (dependencies\nof dependencies) in a flat way, in the same directory as the primary\ndependency that requires it.\nThe key major differences are: \n\nposition in the directory structure no longer predicts the type\n(primary, secondary, etc) a dependency is\ndependency resolution depends on install order, or the order\nin which things are installed will change the node_modules\ndirectory tree structure \n\nImagine we have a module, A. A requires B.\n\nNow, let's create an application that requires module A.\nOn npm install, npm v3 will install both module A and its\ndependency, module B, inside the /node_modules directory, flat.\nIn npm v2 this would have happened in a nested way.\n\nNow, let's say we want to require another module, C. C requires B,\nbut at another version than A.\n\nHowever, since B v1.0 is already a top-level dep, we cannot install\nB v2.0 as a top level dependency. npm v3 handles this by defaulting\nto npm v2 behavior and nesting the new, different, module B version\ndependency under the module that requires it -- in this case, module C.\n\nIn the terminal, this looks like this:\n\nYou can list the dependencies and still see their relationships using\nnpm ls:\n\nIf you want to just see your primary dependencies, you can use:\nnpm ls --depth=0\n\n"},"npm3/duplication.html":{"url":"npm3/duplication.html","title":"Duplication and Deduping","keywords":"","body":"Duplication and Deduping\nLet's continue with our example before. Currently we have an application\nthat depends on 2 modules:\n\nModule-A, depends on Module B v1.0\nModule-C, depends on Module B v2.0\n\n\nNow we ask ourselves, what happens if we install another module that depends\non Module B v1.0? or Module B v2.0?\nExample\nOk, so let's say we want to depend on another package, module D. Module D\ndepends on Module B v2.0, just like Module C.\n\nBecause B v1.0 is already a top-level dependency, we cannot install B v2.0\nas a top level dependency. Therefore Module B v2.0 is installed as a nested\ndependency of Module D, even though we already have a copy installed, nested\nbeneath Module C.\n\nIf a secondary dependency is required by 2+ modules, but was not installed as\na top-level dependency in the directory hierarchy, it will be duplicated and\nnested beneath the primary dependency.\nHowever, if a secondary dependency is required by 2+ modules, but is\ninstalled as a top-level dependency in the directory hierarchy, it will not\nbe duplicated, and will be shared by the primary dependencies that require it.\nFor example, let's say we now want to depend on Module E. Module E, like Module\nA, depends on Module B v1.0.\n\nBecause B v1.0 is already a top-level dependency, we do not need to duplicate\nand nest it. We simply install Module E and it shares Module B v1.0 with\nModule A.\n\nThis appears like this in the terminal:\n\nNow-- what happens if we update Module A to v2.0, which depends on\nModule B v2.0, not Module B v1.0?\n\nThe key is to remember that install order matters.\nEven though Module A was installed first (as v1.0) via our package.json\n(because it is ordered alphabetically), using the interactive npm install\ncommand means that Module A v2.0 is the last package installed.\nAs a result, npm3 does the following things when we run npm install mod-a@2 --save:\n\nit removes Module A v1.0\nit installs Modules A v2.0\nit leaves Module Bv1.0 because Module E v1.0 still depends on it\nit installs Module Bv2.0 as a nested dependency under Module A v2.0, since \nModule B v1.0 is already occupying the top level in the directory hierarchy\n\n\nThis looks like this in the terminal:\n\nFinally, let's also update Module E to v2.0, which also depends on Module B v2.0\ninstead of Module B v1.0, just like the Module A update.\n\nnpm3 performs the following things:\n\nit removes Module E v1.0\nit installs Module E v2.0\nit removes Module B v1.0 because nothing depends on it anymore\nit installs Module B v2.0 in the top level of the directory because there is\nno other version of Module B there\n\n\nThis looks like this in the terminal:\n\nNow, this is clearly not ideal. We have Module B v2.0 in nearly every directory.\nTo get rid of duplication, we can run:\nnpm dedupe\nThis command resolves all of the packages dependencies on Module B v2.0 by\nredirecting them to the top level copy of Module B v2.0 and removes all the\nnested copies.\n\nThis looks like this in the terminal:\n\n"},"npm3/non-determinism.html":{"url":"npm3/non-determinism.html","title":"Non-determinism","keywords":"","body":"Non-determinism\nAs stated a few pages back in our example:\n\nIf you, and your development team, use a package.json, as well\nas the interactive npm install command to add pkgs (like most\nteams using npm do), it is likely that you will run into a situation\nwhere your local node_modules directory will differ from both\nyour coworkers' node_modules directories, as well as the node_modules\ndirectories on your staging, testing, or production servers.\nIn short? npm3 does not install dependencies in a deterministic way.\nThat's probably not a comforting statement to read, but in this article\nwe'll discuss why this happens, as well as assure you that it has no\nimplications for your application, as well as explain the steps to\nreliably (re)create a single, consistent, node_modules directory, should\nyou want to do that.\nExample\nLet's jump back to an example application from a few examples ago:\n\nIn this example, our app has the following package.json:\n{\n  \"name\": \"example3\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"mod-a\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"mod-c\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"mod-d\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"mod-e\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  }\n}\nOn an npm install we will see this in our terminal:\n\nNow, let's say a developer on our team decides to complete a feature that\nrequires that they update Module A to v2.0, which now has a dependency on\nModule B v2.0, instead of, as previously, Module B v1.0.\n\nOur developer uses the interactive npm install command to install the new\nversion of Module A, and save it to the package.json:\nnpm install mod-a@2 --save\nThe terminal outputs this:\n\nWe now have something that looks like this:\n\nNow let's say that our developer finished the feature requiring the new \nversion of Module A and pushes the application to a testing server\nthat runs npm install on the new package.json:\n{\n  \"name\": \"example3\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"mod-a\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"mod-c\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"mod-d\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"mod-e\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  }\n}\nThe testing server's log shows this:\n\nWhich, when visualized, looks like this:\n\nWhoa, what?! This tree is completely different than the tree that\nexists on our developer's local machine. What happened?\nRemember: install order matters.\nWhen our developer updated Module A using the interactive npm install\nModule A v2.0 was functionally the last package installed. Because\nour developer had done an npm install when they first started working\non the project, all modules listed in the package.json were already\ninstalled in the node_modules folder. Then Module A v2.0 was \ninstalled.\nIt follows, then, that Module Bv1.0, a top level dependency because of\nModule A v1.0, then anchored by Module E v1.0, remains a top level\ndependency. Because Module Bv1.0 occupies the top-level, no other version\nof Module B can-- therefore, Module Bv2.0 remains a nested dependency\nunder Module C v1.0 and Module D v1.0, and becomes a nested dependency\nfor the new Module A v2.0 dependency.\nLet's consider what happened on the testing server. The project was pulled\ninto a fresh directory, i.e. does not have a pre-existing node_modules\ndirectory. Then npm install is run, perhaps by a deploy script, to install\ndependencies from the package.json.\nThis package.json now has Module A v2.0 listed in it, and thanks to\nalphabetical order (enforced by the npm install command), is now installed\nfirst, instead of last.\nWhen Module A v2.0 is installed first, in a clear node_modules directory, its\ndependencies are the first candidates for the top-level position. As a result,\nModule B v2.0 is installed in the top-level of the node_modules directory.\nNow, when it is time to install Module E v1.0, its dependency, Module B v1.0,\ncannot occupy the top-level of the node_modules directory, because Module B v2.0\nis already there. Therefore, it is nested under Module E v1.0.\nDo different dependency tree structures affect my app?\nNo! Even though the trees are different, both sufficiently install and point\nall your dependencies at all their dependencies, and so on, down the tree.\nYou still have everything you need, it just happens to be in a different\nconfiguration.\nI want my node_modules directory to be the same. How can I do that?\nThe npm install command, when used exclusively to install packages from a\npackage.json, will always produce the same tree. This is because install order\nfrom a package.json is always alphabetical. Same install order means that\nyou will get the same tree.\nYou can reliably get the same dependency tree by removing your node_modules\ndirectory and running npm install whenever you make a change to your package.json.\n"},"up-and-running/":{"url":"up-and-running/","title":"Up and Running","keywords":"","body":"Up and Running\nUnderstanding how something works is wonderful, but\nit is no replacement for practical hands-on experience.\nLet's get a Node.js development environment set up on \nour computers so that we can start working with npm.\nLearning Objectives\nIn this section, we'll learn:\n\nWhat Node.js is and how to install it\nWhat a Node.js version manager is and why we should use one\nHow to update npm\n\n"},"up-and-running/installation.html":{"url":"up-and-running/installation.html","title":"Installing Node.js and npm","keywords":"","body":"Installing Node.js and npm\nLet's get up and running with Node.js and npm.\nInstalling Node.js\nNode.js is the runtime environment for developing server-side Web Applications in JavaScript.\nYou can test and see if you already have node installed on your machine\nby opening your terminal and typing:\nnode -v\nAny version higher than v0.10.32 will work, but we strongly recommend\nthat you use v4 (LTS) or v6 (current).\nNode.js provides installers for Windows, OS X, and Linux on\n[http://www.nodejs.org].
